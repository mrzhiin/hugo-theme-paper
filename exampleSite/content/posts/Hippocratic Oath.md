I swear by Apollo, the healer, Asclepius, Hygieia, and Panacea, and I take to witness all the gods, all the goddesses, to keep according to my ability and my judgment, the following Oath and agreement:
To consider dear to me, as my parents, him who taught me this art; to live in common with him and, if necessary, to share my goods with him; To look upon his children as my own brothers, to teach them this art.

I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone.I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan; and similarly I will not give a woman a pessary to cause an abortion.But I will preserve the purity of my life and my arts.I will not cut for stone, even for patients in whom the disease is manifest; I will leave this operation to be performed by practitioners, specialists in this art.

In every house where I come I will enter only for the good of my patients, keeping myself far from all intentional ill-doing and all seduction and especially from the pleasures of love with women or with men, be they free or slaves.All that may come to my knowledge in the exercise of my profession or in daily commerce with men, which ought not to be spread abroad, I will keep secret and will never reveal.

If I keep this oath faithfully, may I enjoy my life and practice my art, respected by all men and in all times; but if I swerve from it or violate it, may the reverse be my lot.

敬禀阿波罗、医神阿斯克勒庇俄斯、许癸厄亚、帕那刻亚，及天地诸神圣鉴之，鄙人敬谨宣誓：

余愿尽己之能力与判断力之所及，矢守此约。凡授余艺者：余敬如父母，为终身同甘共苦之侣；倘有急需，余必接济。视彼儿女，犹余手足，如欲受业，余无偿、无条件传授之。凡余之所知，无论口授、书传俱传之吾子、吾师之子、及立誓守此约之生徒，此外不传他人。

余愿尽己之能力与判断力之所及，恪守为病家谋福之信条，并避免一切堕落害人之败行，余必不以毒物药品与他人，并不作此项之指导，虽人请求，亦必不与之，尤不为妇人施堕胎之术。余愿以此纯洁神圣之心，终身执行余之职务。至于手术，另待高明，余不施之，遇结石患者亦然，惟使专匠为之。

无论何适何遇，逢男或女，民人奴隶，余之唯一目的，为病家谋福，并检点吾身，不为种种堕落害人之败行，尤不为诱奸之事。凡余所见所闻，不论有无业务之牵连，余以为不应泄漏者，愿守口如瓶。

倘余严守上述之誓词，愿神仅仅使余之生命及医术，得无上光荣；苟违此誓，天地鬼神共殛之！
